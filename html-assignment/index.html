            Outside of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr>, I have many interests that I love learning about. This past year I have focused a lot of time on learning guitar. I started playing acoustic in a band last spring, then moved on from that in the summmer to learn more intermediate skills and play electric. My favourite genre to play is indie rock or <abbr title="Point of View">POV</abbr> indie. I did a lot of <em>The Backseat Lovers</em> with my band, who are super fun to cover.

            I like this quote because I feel challenged by it to get as much out of this life as possible. On that topic, something I have been very passionate about recently is a short film project I am working on. My friend and I are writing a script, and at the end of the month a few other friends are helping me with acting and filming. It's been super fun so far, and collaborating with friends on a project like this is really cool. We all bounce off each others' creativity so well.

            Also, here's my favourite formula: a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> = (a-b) (a+b).
